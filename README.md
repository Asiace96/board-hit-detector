# board-hit-detector 
Small script for visuazlizing where the ball hit the board in real time for final project of robot juggling arm in univeristy.
The setup is a board with 4 microphones (2 for the x and y axis respectively).
 By measuring the time between the peaks of the threshold amplitude between the microphonoe pairs we can deterimine the ball location on the board in real time.
